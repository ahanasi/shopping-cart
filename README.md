# Shopping Cart App

This project was created as part of the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-shopping-cart). The main goal of this project is to focus on setting up a shopping cart. The homepage/store front is there to practice routing using react-router-dom.

This is a simple app with two pages - the store front and the shopping cart. On the store page, the user will see individual card items for each of the products. Each card will have a number input field, which lets a user manually type in the quantity of the item they want to buy. Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself adjusts, and is displayed on the navbar. Clicking on the cart button will take the user to the cart page where they can view their chosen products and subtotal and edit their shopping cart.
